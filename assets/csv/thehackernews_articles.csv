Cyber Criminals Exploit Open-Source Tools to Compromise Financial Institutions Across Africa,https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/cyber-criminals-exploit-open-source.html,"Jun 26, 2025",Threat Intelligence / Ransomware,"Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a series of cyber attacks targeting financial organizations across Africa since at least July 2023 using a mix of open-source and publicly available tools to maintain access.  Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 is tracking the activity under the moniker  CL-CRI-1014 , where ""CL"" refers to ""cluster"" and ""CRI"" stands for ""criminal motivation.""  It's suspected that the end goal of the attacks is to obtain initial access and then sell it to other criminal actors on underground forums, making the threat actor an initial access broker (IAB).  ""The threat actor copies signatures  from legitimate applications to forge file signatures , to disguise their toolset and mask their malicious activities,"" researchers Tom Fakterman and Guy Levi said . ""Threat actors often spoof legitimate products for malicious purposes.""   The attacks are characterized by the deployment of tools like PoshC2  fo...",

WhatsApp Adds AI-Powered Message Summaries for Faster Chat Previews,https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/whatsapp-adds-ai-powered-message.html,"Jun 26, 2025",Artificial Intelligence / Data Protection,"Popular messaging platform WhatsApp has added a new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered feature that leverages its in-house solution Meta AI to summarize unread messages in chats.  The feature, called Message Summaries, is currently rolling out in the English language to users in the United States, with plans to bring it to other regions and languages later this year.  It ""uses Meta AI to privately and quickly summarize unread messages in a chat, so you can get an idea of what is happening, before reading the details in your unread messages,"" WhatsApp said  in a post.  Message Summaries is optional and is disabled by default. The Meta-owned service said users can also enable "" Advanced Chat Privacy "" to choose which chats can be shared for providing AI-related features.   Most importantly, it's made possible by Private Processing , which WhatsApp launched back in April as a way to enable AI capabilities in a privacy-preserving manner.  Private Processing is de...",

nOAuth Vulnerability Still Affects 9% of Microsoft Entra SaaS Apps Two Years After Discovery,https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/noauth-vulnerability-still-affects-9-of.html,"Jun 25, 2025",SaaS Security / Vulnerability,"New research has uncovered continued risk from a known security weakness in Microsoft's Entra ID , potentially enabling malicious actors to achieve account takeovers in susceptible software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.  Identity security company Semperis, in an analysis  of 104 SaaS applications, found nine of them to be vulnerable to Entra ID cross-tenant nOAuth abuse.  First disclosed by Descope in June 2023, nOAuth  refers to a weakness in how SaaS applications implement OpenID Connect ( OIDC ), which refers to an authentication layer built atop OAuth to verify a user's identity.  The authentication implementation flaw essentially allows a bad actor to change the mail attribute in the Entra ID account to that of a victim's and take advantage of the app's ""Log in with Microsoft"" feature to hijack that account.   The attack is trivial, but it also works because Entra ID permits users to have an unverified email address, opening the door to user imperson...",

Beware the Hidden Risk in Your Entra Environment,https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/beware-hidden-risk-in-your-entra.html,"Jun 25, 2025",Identity Management / Enterprise Security,"If you invite guest users into your Entra ID tenant, you may be opening yourself up to a surprising risk.   A gap in access control in Microsoft Entra's subscription handling is allowing guest users to create and transfer subscriptions into the tenant they are invited into, while maintaining full ownership of them.   All the guest user needs are the permissions to create subscriptions in their home tenant, and an invitation as a guest user into an external tenant. Once inside, the guest user can create subscriptions in their home tenant, transfer them into the external tenant, and retain full ownership rights. This stealthy privilege escalation tactic allows a guest user to gain a privileged foothold in an environment where they should only have limited access.  Many organizations treat guest accounts as low-risk based on their temporary, limited access, but this behavior, which works as designed, opens the door to known attack paths and lateral movement within the resource t...",

""Users can upload and download files, access network drives, and use other resources as if they were on the local network.""  The malicious payload delivered via the rogue VPN software has been codenamed SilentRoute  by Microsoft, which detected the campaign along with the network security company.
